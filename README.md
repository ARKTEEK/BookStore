# BookStore Project

This project was made as a College Assignment for 3rd semester. Entire project was made using [Blazor](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/apps/aspnet/web-apps/blazor) and [EntityFramework](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/entity-framework). Project has all basic CRUD functions for Users, Books and their Purchases. This is my first Web Project, so it has some flaws, which need to be fixed, such as Responsive Design.


## Usage

To start this project you will need to install [.NET 8.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0) and MySQL. You will have to import MySQL dump, to your MySQL before running this project. You can find it (database.sql) in the main project folder.

To edit database login string, you have to change DefaultConnection in appsettings.json file, which you can find in BlazorServer folder.

To start Blazor Website, go into BlazorServer folder and type `dotnet run`.
